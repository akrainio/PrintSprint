A game for the ages.
A Javascript game where one must place various objects onto a 2D grid to guide a computer-controlled
character through a level.
Runs on the Brine engine: http://www.jar42.com/brine/engine/brine.js

Currently code uses expired links to images and sounds, so nothing will display, however the code itself is functioning.
Code written by Andrei Krainiouk, Michael Jako, and Gabe Reyes.
