A game for the ages
A Javascript game where one must place various objects onto a 2D grid to guide a computer-controlled
character through a level.
Currently code uses expired links to images and sounds, so nothing will display, however the code itself is functioning.
Code written by Andrei Krainiouk, Michael Jako, and Gabe Reyes.
